Title: Where Expectations Meet Reality: Realistic Unit Testing
Description: 
    A framework for unit testing for realistic minimalists,
    where we distinguish between expected, acceptable, current, fallback,
    ideal, or regressive behaviour. It can also be used for monitoring
    third-party software projects for changes.
